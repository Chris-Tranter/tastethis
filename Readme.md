#### Testing

#### Encountered Issues
- images that are uploaded are all different sizes, this gives the website an irregular look which was frustrating, i ended up resizing them in paint
but it would be good if i could force an image size on upload
- in mobile view the recipes arent vertically aligned ina single column
- My comments were showing but randomly stopped so i decieded to leave them out

#### Deployment
- Heroku was used to deploy my website. this lets me manage my app in the cloud aswell as allows me to use microservices for site users
